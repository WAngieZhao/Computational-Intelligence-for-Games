DISCUSSION

For this assignment, the major difficulty that I had was trying to increase the
performance by tuning different parameters. I finished the code for q-learning
within a relatively short amount of time. However, multiple parameters are involved
in the algorithm. Thus, I spend a lot of time trying out different values on each
parameter. Sometimes a specific value works well on model 0 but decreases the
performance on model 1. In the end, my algorithm could score 0.51 on model 0 but
only 0.45 on model 1. Overall, I think the bucket boundaries and learning rate
decay value has the most significant impact in terms of increasing performance.
