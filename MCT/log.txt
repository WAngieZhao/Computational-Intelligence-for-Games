DISCUSSION

The major difficulty that I had was trying to increase the NET score/performance. 
At first, there was a minor mistake in the UCB formula I implemented, and my NET 
score for pegging was having an average of -1.5 with --time=0.01 --depth=14. After 
fixing that mistake, the average NET score under the same parameter has increased 
to -0.3, which is close to the number given by the "Testing and Examples". However, 
the average NET for the kalah game stays around -0.6 under --time=0.25 --depth=4 
--random=0.1, which is pretty far away from the given example. Thus, I decided to 
add a tunable bias parameter C to my UCB formula. However, due to the long runtime 
to play kalah games, I did not get many chances to test out different C values.
