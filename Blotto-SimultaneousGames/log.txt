I discussed my solution with: Xinru Li

DISCUSSION

The major difficulty that I had was trying to optimize the time and space
efficiency. I was trying to get rid of recomputing the entire payoff matrix
when running the “--verify”. The optimization I did was only using the
strategies in the input for player 1, and play the strategy against all possible
plays for player 2. Calculate the sum of the strategy weight * (1(win) or
0.5 (tie) or 0(lose)). If the sum we got is greater than 0.5 (tie), which means
we can consider the strategy an equilibrium.  Other than that, I also spend sometime
on figuring out the lottery score when u1=u2=0.
