DISCUSSION

The major difficulty that I had was figuring out the tabulation for the
bottom-up dynamic programming. As I started implementing the functions
for player 2 first, I was trying to implement the dynamic programming
algorithm with a 2-dimensional matrix. It is because, for player 2, the t
(player 1â€™s score) is always set. However, as I started implementing dp1
(the tabulation for player 1), I realized that the dp2 (the tabulation
for player 2) still needs to be 3-dimensional since there are many
possibilities for t when we are using dp2 to build up dp1. Moreover, the
first draft of my code has many repetitive codes. Thus, I spend some time
making the overall code more concise.
